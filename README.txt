Hello!
Some code is taken from this author:
https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/Python-Tetris/blob/master/main.py
https://github.com/WISEPLAT/python-code/tree/master/python-igra-tetris

I tweaked the game a bit for myself, choosing a different theme from my favorite anime,
choosing a different font, game window size, and other backgrounds.
